Feel free to read me... or not...

This is a simple project for myself to learn Python backend using FastAPI. 
The idea for developing this project is simple enough, as I like to explore new foods and restaurants around the city - I found it hard sometimes which place to choose given the extensive amount of different places around where I live in!

The solution is super simple! I want to make a tool where I can retrieve random retaurants or places to eat everytime I pull up the website. 

I am using Python as I primarily learned Python when I was in Uni and I think it is wise enough to just continue on using the knowledge I have and keep going from there :). 

I use FastAPI for handling all the backend work - note that eventhough I learnt Python back in Uni. My knowledge about programming is still new and there are many learning curves that I need to face!
